### I make a lot of random things, some of which are useful!  

I always read any & all reported issues, if you find a problem with one of my programs I'll fix it ASAP.  

Some useful projects I've made:
- [ARRCON](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON)  
  An interactive shell prompt and administrator utility compatible with any game using the widely-used Source RCON protocol.
- [Volume Control](https://github.com/radj307/volume-control)  
  A hotkey utility for Windows that lets you control the volume of global applications using global customizable hotkeys.  
  Works with everything that Windows recognizes in the volume mixer, and supports rebinding the volume rocker on keyboards.
- [Gamebryo Engine Unit Converter](https://github.com/radj307/Gamebryo-Engine-Unit-Converter)  
  The first (and only afaik) utility for converting between metric/imperial and the elusive "Unit" used by Bethesda's Gamebryo/Creation engines.
- [Another Archery Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53810)  
  Mutagen patcher for Skyrim (LE/SE/AE) that allows modifying projectile physics & engine flags.  
  Fully customizable projectile overhaul that is compatible with all mods, includes everything from AAT & more.
- [Another Archery Tweak]() for [Skyrim Special Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41018)  
  Just another modular archery physics overhaul that focuses on fixing the many bugs present in the game, especially for stealth archers.
- [SpeedAndReachFixes](https://github.com/Synthesis-Collective/speedandreachfixes) Mutagen Patcher  
  The Synthesis version of GodlySandwich's zEdit patcher of the same name.  
  Provides a highly configurable and expandable weapon handling overhaul and bug fix compendium compatible with any Skyrim release.
- [Skyrim Alchemy CLI Utility](https://github.com/radj307/alch)  
  This was a personal project because I wanted a clean, fast, and powerful commandline utility for Skyrim's alchemy system.
  Started as a lightweight alternative to [dhildebr's caco-potion-builder](https://github.com/dhildebr/caco-potion-builder), but quickly eclipsed it in terms of features.
