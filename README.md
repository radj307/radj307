### I make a lot of random things, some of which are useful!  

Feedback is always appreciated, and I'm always willing to collaborate.  
I always read any/all reported issues, if you find a problem with one of my programs I'll fix it ASAP.  

Some useful projects I've made:
- ARRCON  
  An RCON Client based on [mcrcon](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon) that supports a wider variety of games.
- Gamebryo Engine Unit Converter  
  The first (and only afaik) utility for converting between metric/imperial and the elusive "Unit" used by Bethesda's Gamebryo/Creation engines.
- Another Archery Tweak/Patcher  
  An archery overhaul mod in the form of a Mutagen Synthesis patcher.
- The Synthesis patcher for wSkeever's [Quest Journal Limit Fixer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56130) mod.  
  Fixes a long-standing bug with the Creation engine where having too many active quests would cause objectives to be erased.
- CACO Potion Builder CLI  
  This was a personal project because I wanted a clean, fast, and powerful commandline utility for Skyrim's alchemy system.
  Started as a lightweight alternative to [dhildebr's caco-potion-builder](https://github.com/dhildebr/caco-potion-builder), but quickly eclipsed it in terms of features.
