### I make a lot of random things, some of which are useful!  

I always read any & all reported issues, if you find a problem with one of my programs I'll fix it ASAP.  

Some useful projects I've made:
- [ARRCON](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON)  
  An RCON Client based on [mcrcon](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon) that supports a wider variety of games.
- [Gamebryo Engine Unit Converter](https://github.com/radj307/Gamebryo-Engine-Unit-Converter)  
  The first (and only afaik) utility for converting between metric/imperial and the elusive "Unit" used by Bethesda's Gamebryo/Creation engines.
- [Another Archery Tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41018)  
  Archery physics overhaul that also includes a number of bug fixes, especially for stealth archers.
- [Another Archery Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53810)  
  Customizable archery physics overhaul that is compatible with all mods, includes everything from AAT & more.
- [Quest Journal Limit Fixer Synthesis Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56130)  
  Fixes a long-standing bug with the Creation engine where having too many active quests would cause objectives to be erased.
- [Volume Control](https://github.com/radj307/volume-control)  
  Simple Windows application that adds hotkeys for controlling the volume of a specific application using the Windows Audio Mixer.  
  Also has a CLI version.
- [Skyrim Alchemy CLI Utility](https://github.com/radj307/alch)  
  This was a personal project because I wanted a clean, fast, and powerful commandline utility for Skyrim's alchemy system.
  Started as a lightweight alternative to [dhildebr's caco-potion-builder](https://github.com/dhildebr/caco-potion-builder), but quickly eclipsed it in terms of features.
