Some of the things I've made:

### Programs

- [ARRCON](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON)  
  An RCON client compatible with the widely-used Source RCON protocol.  
  Rather than focusing on 
- [Volume Control](https://github.com/radj307/volume-control)  
  A hotkey utility for Windows that lets you control the volume of specific applications using global customizable hotkeys.  
  Works with everything that Windows recognizes in the volume mixer, and supports rebinding the volume rocker on keyboards.
- [mousetrap](https://github.com/radj307/mousetrap)  
  A crude utility that prevents your mouse cursor from leaving a specified monitor. Useful for games that don't lock the mouse themselves.
- [Gamebryo Engine Unit Converter](https://github.com/radj307/Gamebryo-Engine-Unit-Converter)  
  The first (and only afaik) utility for converting between metric/imperial and the elusive "Unit" used by Bethesda's Gamebryo/Creation engines.
- [Skyrim Alchemy CLI Utility](https://github.com/radj307/alch)  
  This was a personal project because I wanted a clean, fast, and powerful commandline utility for Skyrim's alchemy system.
  Started as a lightweight alternative to [dhildebr's caco-potion-builder](https://github.com/dhildebr/caco-potion-builder), but quickly eclipsed it in terms of features.
